{"name":"Later Dude","tagline":"Your Friendly URL and File Dropbox on the OS X Dashboard.","body":"# Later Dude Widget for Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n![Drag and drop URLs and files on and from your dashboard.](http://janpunktde.de/later-dude/img/drag-and-drop.png)\r\n\r\nLater Dude provides a convenient way for you to remember URLs, files, folders and pretty much anything you can drag and drop on Mac OS X. You just start dragging your item of choice, fire up the dashboard, and drop it like it's hot on your Later Dude widget. Later Dude stores a reference to the item for later use. You can click on the item to open it with its default application (web browser for URLs, Finder for folders, etc.) or drag it back out, say to drop a file onto a file chooser dialogue to save yourself a few clicks. Note that Later Dude only keeps the URI of an item, not the item itself, so make sure not to delete files or folders you want to reference later.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nMac OS X v10.4 Tiger is required. If you're using Safari, click the download link. When the widget download is complete, the widget installer appears. Click Install if you want the widget installed on your Mac. If you're using a browser other than Safari, click the download link. When the widget download is complete, unarchive and open it to show the widget installer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
