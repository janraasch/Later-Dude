{"name":"Later Dude","tagline":"Your Friendly URL and File Dropbox on the OS X Dashboard.","body":"# Later Dude Widget for Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n![Drag and drop URLs and files on and from your dashboard.](http://janpunktde.de/later-dude/img/drag-and-drop.png \"laterdude\")\r\n\r\nLater Dude provides a convenient way for you to remember URLs, files, folders and pretty much anything you can drag and drop on Mac OS X. \r\n  * Start dragging your item of choice, fire up the dashboard, and drop it like it's hot on your Later Dude widget. Later Dude stores a reference to the item for later use. \r\n  * Click on the item to open it with its default application (web browser for URLs, Finder for folders, etc.) or drag it back out, say to drop a file onto a file chooser dialogue to save yourself a few clicks. \r\n  \r\n_Note that Later Dude only keeps the URI of an item, not the item itself, so make sure not to delete files or folders you want to reference later._\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nMac OS X v10.4 Tiger is required. \r\n* Safari: \r\n * Click the download link. \r\n * When the widget download is complete, the widget installer appears. \r\n * Click Install if you want the widget installed on your Mac. \r\n* If you're using a browser other than Safari: \r\n * Click the download link. \r\n * When the widget download is complete, unarchive and \r\n * Open it to show the widget installer.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Previously dropped items are clickable and draggable.](http://janpunktde.de/later-dude/img/drag-start.png \"laterdudedemo1\")\r\n\r\n![You can even use Later Dude as an app launcher.](http://janpunktde.de/later-dude/img/application-launcher.png \"laterdudedemo2\")","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
